# <p align = 'center'>Analysis of Motor Collision in New York City (2012 - 2022)</p>

## Overview:
Within the five boroughs that make up New York City, around 8.2 million people dwell. Thousands of accidents occur each year as a result of a variety of circumstances. The NYPD gathers data on each of these accidents and makes it available to the public on `nycopendata.socrata.com`. We decided to dig deeper into the crash data to see if there were any underlying patterns or relationships that could explain the high frequency of collisions. From `July 2012` to `March 2022`, the data included almost `2,00,000`Â observations.

## Data Description:
The Motor Vehicle Collisions crash table contains details on the crash event. Each row represents a crash event. The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage

## Questions for Analysis:
Before exploring the data, we created a list of questions we wanted to address:

1. Is there a trend in the number of accidents?
2. Is there a relationship between the time of day and the contributing factors of the accident? (`Time Series Analysis`)
3. Which areas are more "Collision-prone" areas? (`Collision prone analysis`)

## Methods:
For Performing our "Analysis" we have used `Google Clould Platform` and `Tableau`, and `Python` to perform "Data Cleaning".

1. Google Cloud Platform Analysis Results:

A) Most Injuries and Deaths were caused due to which Vehicle type?
